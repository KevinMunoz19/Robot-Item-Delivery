# Robot-Item-Delivery

The connection between MATLAB and V-Rep presents the oportunity for the simulation of a robot that delivers three items inside a house by controling the actuator (arm) and the movement. The position of the objects and the delivery place are obtained by computer vision. The movement of the robot is determined by the D-Star algorithm, that finds the optimal route for the robot to reach the desired position in the house.

The report can be found in the "Proyecto Robotica" PDF file. This file includes the methods used for the simulation, as well as the results and a youtube link to watch the simulation.

This projects Uses MATLAB and V-Rep, as well as the peter cork robotics Toolbox for MATLAB.
